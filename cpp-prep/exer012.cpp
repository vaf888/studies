	}


	//a. What is the output of the loop as it is written?
	//answer: 0

	//b. Correct the syntax of the loop so that the logic of the corrected 
	//loop corresponds to the formatting of
	//the original loop. 
	//What is the output of the corrected loop?
	//answer: 25 4 1 0 -> with a LF after each one

	//c. Correct the formatting of the (original) loop so that the new 
	//format reflects the logical behavior of the original loop.


	//TODO
