/*
        demangle executables:

1) put c++ source & assembly side by side:
	  objdump -drwC test001`

2)        nm a.out | c++filt  -> e.g. nm ../bin/rm-fix-shared-ptr | c++filt


        (*)  GNU nm lists the symbols from object files objfileâ€¦. If no object files are
             listed as arguments, nm assumes the file a.out.

        (**) c++filt - demangling:
                 The c++filt program does the inverse mapping: it decodes (demangles) low-level
                 names into user-level names so that they can be read.

3) at comp time:
   gcc -c -g -Wa,-a,-ad foo.c > foo.lst
